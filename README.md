## Job experiences

### Sicoob Agrotech · Freelance
**Full Stack Developer**
> December 2023 - April 2024

### Sicoob Credisul · Full-time
**Full Stack Developer**
> May 2023 - Present

> Skills: Docker · React.js · SSH · Next.js · NestJS · CSS · Nginx · Microsoft Excel · IBM Cognos Analytics · PostgreSQL

At Sicoob Credisul, I work in all phases of the software project lifecycle. This includes ideation, collaborating with all departments to understand their needs, developing interface prototypes, validating requirements, structuring systems for scalability and efficiency, and managing databases.

I utilize JavaScript and Next.js on the front end and Nest.js on the back end for coding the systems.

I lead the "Corporate Performance" project, applying ETL to extract financial data and integrating with IBM Cognos for data collection, with authentication via Azure Active Directory. We also implemented an administration tool that allows data entry in Excel format, with rigorous validations.

I also worked on the "Voyager" project, which has similar principles to the previous project but with much greater scalability, given the larger problems and implementations with Azure services.

### Postos Mirian · Full-time
**Full Stack Developer**
> October 2022 - May 2023 · 8 months

> Skills: Docker · Node.js · JSON · React.js · JavaScript · SSH · NestJS · TypeScript · Nest.js 

At Postos Mirian, I gained significant experience working on a project known as M-park. This project aimed to enhance truck parking control at stations near cargo movement areas.

My role encompassed the front end, using React.js to create a user-friendly interface, charts, and a design pattern that improved user experience. I integrated session control features, ensuring the app's security and fluidity. On the back end with NestJS, I focused on user authentication, database rules, and integration with Totvs Protheus, essential for system efficiency as it collected data for our application, making the service more refined and database queries more efficient.

One of the system's most impressive features is its ability to monitor trucks' entry and exit in the yard. It provides detailed information on the time elapsed since truck arrival, the number of invoices received for unloading at ports, and the expected departure times for all trucks. All this is presented graphically, in detail, analytically, and concisely, making monitoring and decision-making more effective.

Additionally, the system offers user control, allowing account registration and password changes via email, simplifying and securing account management. We also integrated features like Google reCAPTCHA and Google Analytics to monitor platform usability, crucial for enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

Participating in this project from start to finish was an enriching experience, facing technical challenges and contributing to M-PARK. I am proud to have played a vital role in creating this valuable tool, which was a unique opportunity for learning and growth.
